### Hi there ðŸ‘‹



I'm an experienced engineer and technical innovator, specialising in the semantic space, with a drive to re-imagine the future of design, simulation and manufacturing; I've worked in a variety of positions, typically end-to-end (as project analyst/architect, developer) in a fast-paced, project-oriented organisation.
