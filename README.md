### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
![alt text](http://url/to/img.png)

I'm an experienced engineer and technical innovator, specialising in the semantic space, with a drive to re-imagine the future of design, simulation and manufacturing; I've worked in a variety of positions, typically end-to-end (as project analyst/architect, developer) in a fast-paced, project-oriented organisation.


- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on the development of Digital Twins Platforms that with Integrated Machine Learning are hugely novel in the aerospace and medical component manufacturing sectors
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning more about combining Knowledge Graph and Graph Algorithms to Find Hidden Skills at aerospace sector.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything related to the semantic and machine learning, I am happy to help.
